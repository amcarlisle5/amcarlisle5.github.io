			<P>GROCERY LIST STAPLES</P>
			<p class="mart3">Grocery list essentials often include pantry staples like rice, pasta, canned beans, and sauces, which can serve as the foundation for many meals. Fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables add color, flavor, and essential nutrients to your diet. Protein sources like chicken, eggs, and tofu are versatile options that can be incorporated into various dishes. Dairy or non-dairy alternatives like milk, yogurt, and cheese provide calcium and protein. Other items like bread, cereal, and snacks can round out your list, ensuring you have a variety of options for meals and snacks throughout the week.</p>

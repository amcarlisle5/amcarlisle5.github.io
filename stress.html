			<P>STRESS MANAGEMENT AND TIPS/TRICKS</P>
			<p>Dealing with stress can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. One approach is to practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. These activities can help calm the mind and reduce feelings of anxiety. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep can support overall well-being and resilience to stress. It's also important to identify the sources of stress in your life and find ways to manage or reduce them. This might involve setting boundaries, seeking support from friends or a therapist, or learning to prioritize and delegate tasks. Ultimately, finding healthy ways to cope with stress can improve your mental and physical health in the long run.</p>
